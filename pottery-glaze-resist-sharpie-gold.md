## Problem

When glazing pottery, ceramists need methods to resist glaze in specific areas to create patterns or leave sections unglazed. Traditional methods include:
- Wax resist
- Masking tape
- Vinyl tape

These methods can be time-consuming or require specific materials that may not always be readily available.

## Solution

Use a **Sharpie Gold Pen** as a glaze resist:

1. Apply the Sharpie gold pen to bisqueware in areas where you want to resist the glaze
2. Allow the ink to dry completely
3. Apply glaze as normal
4. The Sharpie ink will burn off during firing, leaving the marked areas unglazed
